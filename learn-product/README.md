# PM Mastery System

A structured learning system for becoming a world-class IC Product Manager, built from real feedback patterns and frameworks from top product leaders.

---

## What is This?

This is a **personalized PM development system** designed from:
- **Real feedback patterns** from manager reviews and 1:1s
- **Proven frameworks** from Lenny's Podcast guests (Ian McAllister, Shaun Clowes, Jackie Bavaro)
- **Actionable questions** to build muscle memory for PM excellence

### Why This Exists

Most PM advice is generic. This system is built from **your actual feedback themes** mapped to **battle-tested frameworks** from PMs at Amazon, Atlassian, Confluent, Airbnb, and more.

## Quick Reference: The 18 Core Questions

### Communication
- [ ] Did I answer the EXACT question first?
- [ ] Did I say "This means..." and "So we should..."?
- [ ] Did the message land? (Self-grade)

### Data
- [ ] What happened upstream/downstream of this data?
- [ ] What's the metric one level up?
- [ ] Do I have baseline metrics?

### Ownership
- [ ] Am I waiting for permission unnecessarily?
- [ ] Can I post this publicly without asking?
- [ ] What would I do as CEO of this metric?

### Strategy
- [ ] What does the customer actually experience?
- [ ] What are competitors doing?
- [ ] Have I verified this problem exists in the wild?

### PRD Quality
- [ ] Does this have a clear PROBLEM paragraph?
- [ ] Controllable vs track-only metrics?
- [ ] What are the guardrails?

### Leadership
- [ ] Did I sell impact in stakeholder language?
- [ ] Have I repeated this win enough to stick?

### PLG (Product-Led Growth)
- [ ] Can I define my activation metric precisely?
- [ ] Am I reviewing funnel metrics weekly?
