# Module 6: Product-Led Growth (PLG)

## 2-Minute Overview

This module teaches you how to build products that sell themselves. Based on Shaun Clowes' experience building the first B2B growth team at Atlassian (which grew to 300,000+ customers), you'll learn the fundamentals of PLG, how to balance it with sales-led motions, and how to measure what matters.

**Your Context:** Working on PLG at PushOwl - pricing experiments, activation, retention

**Your Goal:** Build systematic growth capabilities, not just one-off wins

## Why PLG Matters

From Shaun Clowes (CPO, Confluent; ex-Atlassian):

> "There is not a natural force that pulls companies towards thinking about the end user's enjoyment and success early in their journey. If there is nobody in the organization whose true incentive is to measure end user success, their enjoyment, their happiness, their retention, their engagement early on—it will not happen. Or at best it will be a hobby."

### The Defensibility of PLG

> "If I look back on my time at Atlassian... something like 300,000 customers. Let's say you're going up against Jira and you're like, 'I'm going to pick off 1,000 customers.' That's a lot. But you still have 299,000 to go. It's very hard to assail a company which has a very large number of customers AND a very large amount of revenue."

## Success Metrics

### You've Mastered This When:

- ✅ You can define your activation metric precisely
- ✅ You have a weekly funnel review habit
- ✅ Experiments are systematic, not random
- ✅ You can explain retention cohort by cohort
- ✅ PLG and Sales work together, not against

### Warning Signs:

- ⚠️ "Activation" means different things to different people
- ⚠️ Growth wins don't compound
- ⚠️ Experiments feel random, not systematic
- ⚠️ Retention numbers are aggregate, not segmented
- ⚠️ Sales sees PLG as competition
